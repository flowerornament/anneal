# anneal v2.0 — Programmable Corpus Runtime

A knowledge corpus is a graph of typed handles with addressable content,
relationships, lifecycle state, and history. anneal v2.0 is the runtime
that makes that graph queryable, extensible, and durable across sessions
— for any source that can produce handles and edges, not just markdown.

The product is:

- **A substrate**: a Datalog dialect with stored and derived primitives,
  a convergence standard library, self-description, and provenance.
- **A family of sources**: format adapters that turn markdown, MDX, code,
  issue trackers, host applications, and future formats into handle/edge
  facts the substrate can reason about. Sources are the only
  data-ingestion boundary; ranking, authorization, trail policy, and
  search backends are separate extension seams.
- **Two surfaces**: a CLI for humans and shell scripts; an MCP server
  for agents. Both project the same runtime contracts.

What makes a system *anneal* is the convergence vocabulary —
settledness as a first-class dimension. The substrate ships that
vocabulary as readable, overridable `.dl` files. Every project can
use it as-is, replace it, or extend it for the work that matters to
that team.

---

## Part I: Why this shape [CR-F]

### §1 The thing agents need

A cold agent arriving in a knowledge corpus has four problems:

1. **Localization.** "Where is the thing relevant to my task?"
2. **Composition.** "What's the connection between these things?"
3. **Memory.** "What did the previous agent decide?"
4. **Extension.** "How do I leave my learning behind?"

anneal v2.0 answers each as a runtime primitive: `search` for
localization, the Datalog dialect for composition, `*trail` and
snapshots for memory, `@verb` and `anneal.dl` for extension.

### §2 Why substrate, not a markdown tool [CR-D1]

**Definition CR-D1 (Substrate).** A program that exposes a typed
knowledge-graph runtime, format-agnostic, with sources as plug-ins.
The substrate's value compounds across every source it can ingest;
markdown is one source among many.

Treating anneal as "the markdown corpus tool" loses three futures the
substrate makes natural:

- **MDX, AsciiDoc, org-mode, JSON-schema, YAML, code, issue trackers**
  — every format is an adapter; the convergence vocabulary and query
  language are the same.
- **Anneal embedded in another application** — host-corpus, an Ash app,
  any host that wants its own runtime state to be agent-queryable.
- **Multi-corpus federation** — an agent works across several
  corpora simultaneously (a project's design docs, its source code,
  its related upstream projects).

The substrate also future-proofs against agent evolution: today's
agents have specific shapes (token budgets, no shared memory). The
primitives, self-description, trails, and programmable extension
survive any agent generation.

### §3 The cold-agent test [CR-D2]

**Definition CR-D2 (Cold-agent test).** Given a real corpus and a
goal, a cold agent (no prior session memory of the corpus) reaches
the answer in ≤2 tool calls plus optional `--explain`.

This is the product's primary acceptance criterion. Engine viability
(MVS coverage, perf gates) is necessary but not sufficient. The
test is fixture-pinned in §44 — count alone is gameable; the spec
names specific corpora, queries, expected handles, and rank
tolerances.

---

## Part II: Architecture [CR-A]

### §4 Three layers [CR-D3]

**Definition CR-D3 (Layering).**

| Layer | Form | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Substrate** | `anneal-core` crate | Datalog runtime, primitives, convergence stdlib, IR, provenance, trail capture |
| **Adapters** | `anneal-md`, `anneal-mdx`, `anneal-code`, `anneal-host`, … | Format-specific extraction; implement [`Source`](#5-the-source-trait-cr-d4) |
| **Surfaces** | `anneal-cli`, `anneal-mcp`, library API | Project the substrate to humans, agents, and host applications |

### §5 The Source trait [CR-D4]

**Definition CR-D4 (Source trait).** The contract every adapter
implements. Sources are the only data-ingestion extensibility point.
*Other* extension seams (ranking/scoring, authorization policy, trail
summarization, MCP tool registration) are separate plugin surfaces
declared in Part VII.

```rust
pub trait Source {
    /// Self-describe what this source recognizes, snapshot capability
    /// declarations, and the discovery-fact keys it consumes.
    fn describe(&self) -> SourceInfo;

    /// Extract facts. Sources do not write to shared mutable state;
    /// they return a FactBatch which the runtime merges atomically
    /// with generation tracking.
    fn extract(&self, cx: &SourceContext) -> Result<FactBatch, SourceError>;
}

pub struct SourceContext<'a> {
    pub corpus: CorpusId,                  // logical corpus this Source contributes to
    pub roots: &'a [Utf8Path],             // where the Source's data lives
    pub config_facts: &'a ConfigFacts,     // pre-loaded discovery facts (see §7)
    pub time_ref: Option<TimeRef>,         // None = current; Some = historical
    pub previous_generation: Option<Generation>,  // for incremental delta extraction
    pub actor: ActorContext,               // identity + capabilities for policy enforcement
    pub cancellation: CancellationToken,
}

pub struct FactBatch {
    pub mode: FactBatchMode,              // FullSnapshot or Delta
    pub generation: Generation,            // monotonic; runtime treats new gen as supersede
    pub handles: Vec<HandleFact>,
    pub edges: Vec<EdgeFact>,
    pub content: Vec<ContentFact>,
    pub spans: Vec<SpanFact>,
    pub meta: Vec<MetaFact>,
    pub concerns: Vec<ConcernFact>,
    pub retractions: Vec<NativeId>,        // used only for Delta batches
}

pub enum FactBatchMode {
    FullSnapshot,                          // replaces all current facts for (corpus, source)
    Delta,                                 // upserts facts and retracts listed native ids
}

pub struct SourceInfo {
    pub name: &'static str,                // "markdown", "mdx", "rust-code", "github-issues"
    pub recognizes: Vec<Pattern>,          // ["**/*.md"]
    pub doc: &'static str,
    pub config_keys: Vec<ConfigKey>,       // adapter-qualified discovery facts consumed
    pub capabilities: SourceCapabilities,  // see §11
    pub search: Option<SearchInfo>,        // search scoring contract if the Source contributes hits
}

pub struct SourceCapabilities {
    pub supports_git_ref: bool,            // can re-extract against arbitrary git refs
    pub supports_time_snapshot: bool,      // honors SourceContext.time_ref
    pub supports_incremental: bool,        // honors previous_generation for deltas
    pub live_only: bool,                   // historical at() returns "unsupported" not silent
}

pub struct SearchInfo {
    pub reason_vocabulary: Vec<&'static str>,
    pub fields: Vec<&'static str>,
    pub low_confidence_threshold: f32,      // default 0.5 if omitted
}
```

A `Source` is one of: a directory walker (markdown, MDX, AsciiDoc),
a source-code analyzer (anneal-code), an external-system reader
(GitHub issues, CI events), or a host application's runtime
introspector (anneal-host: host-corpus's Ash resources, Phoenix routes,
Oban jobs as handles).

The runtime is identical across sources. Only the extraction differs.

### §6 Other extension seams [CR-D5]

**Definition CR-D5 (Plugin surfaces).** v2.0 names four extension
seams beyond `Source` so adapter authors don't contort everything
into fact-emission:

| Surface | Trait | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Data ingestion | `Source` | Emit handle/edge/content facts |
| Ranking and scoring | `Ranker` | Per-adapter `search` score calibration; tie-break policy |
| Authorization policy | `Policy` | Actor → allow/deny on read/search/eval; scoped to MCP and host-embed |
| Trail summarization | `TrailSummarizer` | Engine-generated trail-entry summaries with privacy-aware redaction |

`Ranker` and `Policy` ship default implementations in `anneal-core`.
Adapters and hosts override them; the runtime uses the most-specific
one. `TrailSummarizer` is mandatory per §13 because trail privacy
needs explicit per-corpus configuration.

### §7 Ingestion lifecycle [CR-D6]

**Definition CR-D6 (Ingestion lifecycle).** Each invocation of the
runtime executes these phases in order:

```
1. Adapter registration: link Source impls into the binary.
2. Phase A — config parse:
   a. Read anneal.toml (lattice, [convergence], policies, source bindings).
   b. Parse anneal.dl, splitting into:
      - discovery facts (file_extension, label_pattern, code_language, …)
      - rule clauses (Horn rules with `:=`)
      - verb declarations (@verb annotations)
3. Phase B — Source extraction:
   a. For each enabled Source, build SourceContext from anneal.toml + discovery facts.
   b. Source.extract(cx) → FactBatch.
   c. Runtime merges batches with generation tracking:
      - FullSnapshot replaces all current facts for (corpus, source).
      - Delta upserts returned facts and retracts listed native ids.
4. Phase C — rule load:
   a. Load embedded prelude (graph.dl, convergence.dl, checks.dl, ranking.dl, views.dl).
   b. Load anneal.dl rule clauses.
   c. Resolve verb registrations.
   d. Static analysis: stratification, safety, diagnostic ID uniqueness/prefixes.
5. Phase D — evaluation:
   a. IR fixpoint over current generation of facts.
   b. Surface accepts queries; runtime evaluates.
   c. Trail capture per §13.
```

Discovery facts are consumed by Sources in Phase B, not by the IR.
Rules and verbs are loaded in Phase C, after facts exist. This
resolves the contradiction Phase 1 would have hit had `anneal.dl`
needed to load all-at-once.

A long-running runtime (MCP server, embedded host) keeps populated
relations in memory and re-runs Phase B on source-change events;
generation tracking handles retractions. A deleted file or host
object disappears because a FullSnapshot no longer contains it, or
because a Delta batch lists its `native_id` in `retractions`.

### §8 Crate topology

```
anneal/
├── crates/
│   ├── anneal-core/             # the substrate
│   ├── anneal-md/               # markdown adapter
│   ├── anneal-cli/              # the binary; links core + md
│   └── anneal-mcp/              # MCP server; links core + md
├── adapters/                    # external adapter crates (v2.1+)
│   ├── anneal-mdx/
│   ├── anneal-code/
│   └── anneal-host/
└── .design/
```

`anneal-core` is the only crate other anneal crates depend on.
Adapters are siblings. A consumer can link any combination of
adapters into their own binary; the CLI ships markdown by default.

---

## Part III: Substrate primitives [CR-P]

### §9 Identity model [CR-D7]

**Definition CR-D7 (Identity).** Every fact carries enough origin to
distinguish it across corpora, sources, and adapter combinations.
Internal identity is `(corpus, source, kind, native_id)`; display
identity is the user-friendly id the adapter chose.

This applies from v2.0, not v2.2, because adding fields later forces
a query-breaking schema migration. Federation UI can defer; the
schema cannot.

### §10 Stored relations [CR-D8]

**Definition CR-D8 (Stored primitives).** The relations every adapter
populates and every rule may join on.

```
*handle{
  id,           // display id, locally unique within (corpus, source)
  kind,         // "file" | "section" | "label" | "version" | "external"
  status,       // string in the project lattice; may be null
  namespace,    // string; "" if not labeled
  file,         // adapter-meaningful path or locator
  line,         // declaration line; 0 if not applicable
  date,         // ISO date; may be null
  area,         // top-level grouping (first path component or adapter-defined)
  summary,      // short text; adapter-generated
  corpus,       // CorpusId
  source,       // "markdown" | "mdx" | "rust-code" | host-defined
  native_id,    // adapter-private id used for delta tracking
  origin_uri,   // canonical URI (file://, https://, app://host-corpus/ash/User, …)
  revision,     // source revision (git sha, file mtime hash, app-version)
  generation    // monotonic; latest generation wins on conflict
}

*edge{from, to, kind, file, line, corpus, source, generation}

*meta{handle, key, value, corpus, source, generation}

*content{
  handle, span_id, lines, text, tokens, corpus, source, generation
}

*span{
  id, handle, start_line, end_line, summary, corpus, source, generation
}

*concern{name, member, source, corpus, generation}

*config{key, value, corpus}               // from anneal.toml; runtime-populated
*snapshot{at, id, key, value, corpus}
*trail{...}                                // see §13
*generation{corpus, source, current}       // current generation per (corpus, source)
```

| Relation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*handle` | Identity: every thing the corpus knows about |
| `*edge` | Typed binary relationships |
| `*meta` | Open key/value extension on handles |
| `*content` | Bounded text spans of a handle; the read-substrate |
| `*span` | Citable region with line range and engine-generated summary |
| `*concern` | Cross-cutting groupings: any handle can belong to any concern |
| `*config` | Runtime configuration as queryable facts (lattice, namespaces) |
| `*snapshot` | Historical handle state from snapshot history |
| `*trail` | Session paths (§13) |
| `*generation` | Per-source generation tracker (§7); supports retraction |

Every source-derived stored relation is **adapter-populated and
generation-tracked**. `*config` is runtime-populated but still
corpus-scoped so federation never merges two corpora's config facts.
The runtime atomically swaps a `FullSnapshot` generation for an
entire `(corpus, source)` or applies a `Delta` batch's upserts and
retractions. This makes long-running runtimes (MCP, host-embed)
correct under source edits and deletions.

### §11 Engine-derived predicates [CR-D9]

**Definition CR-D9 (Function primitives).** Predicates implemented in
the substrate (not as Datalog rules) because they need Rust-native
traversal, IO, ranking, or content access. **All return relational
shapes** — pattern matching binds variables; no record-style field
access.

```
// Graph
upstream(h, anc)
downstream(h, desc)
impact(h, x, depth)
neighborhood(h, depth, member)

// Status and lifecycle (work against the configured lattice)
terminal(h)
active(h)
settled(h)
pipeline_position(h, n)
pipeline_position_for(s, n)

// Obligation lifecycle
obligation(h)
discharged(h)
undischarged(h)

// Counts and metrics
cite_count(h, n)
in_degree(h, n)
out_degree(h, n)
discharge_count(h, n)
freshness(h, days)
flux(h, days, delta)             // ground `days`; binds `delta`
token_estimate(h, n)

// Content retrieval — all RELATIONAL
search(query, handle, span_id, score, reason, field, low_confidence)
read(handle, budget, span_id, text, start_line, end_line, tokens)
read_full(handle, content)       // capability-gated; see §16
match(pattern, handle, line, snippet)

// Self-description
schema(name, kind, signature, determinism, source_provenance)
predicates(name, doc, source_file, source_lines)
verbs(name, query, doc, output_schema)
describe(name, doc)
source_of(name, file, lines)     // renamed from `source` to avoid collision with *source field
examples(name, example)
sources(name, recognizes, capabilities, doc)
```

The aggregation form `TopK{k: N, key: score : body}` (Part IV §17) provides
bounded selection. There is no parallel `top_k` function primitive
and no surface syntax shortcut — one mechanism, one place.

### §12 Search scoring contract [CR-D10]

**Definition CR-D10 (Search contract).** Every adapter that
contributes search results emits raw `SearchHit` candidates. The
runtime passes candidates through the active `Ranker` before exposing
the public `search(...)` relation, so the `score` column agents see
is calibrated for the loaded adapter set.

- Public `score` is a calibrated float in `[0.0, 1.0]`. 1.0 means
  "strongest match after the active Ranker"; 0.0 means "no signal."
- Adapter raw scores are **not** directly comparable. Provenance may
  expose both `raw_score` and calibrated `score`; ordinary queries
  see only calibrated `score`. The default `Ranker` ships with
  documented calibration; projects override via `[ranking]` in
  `anneal.toml`.
- `reason` is a short string explaining the match
  (`"title-substring"`, `"semantic-cluster"`,
  `"frontmatter-key-match"`). Adapters document their reason
  vocabulary in `SourceInfo`.
- `field` names which logical field of the handle matched (`"title"`,
  `"body"`, `"frontmatter:status"`, `"identifier"`). Used by agents
  to decide whether a hit is structural or content-based.
- Ordering by `score` is deterministic given a fixed corpus state and
  query; tie-breakers documented per `Ranker`.
- **Confidence threshold.** Each adapter declares a
  `low_confidence_threshold: f32` in `SourceInfo.search` (default
  `0.5`). Hits with calibrated `score < threshold` carry
  `low_confidence: true` in the relation, signalling agents that
  the hit is plausible but uncertain. The default `Ranker` filters
  low-confidence hits from `TopK` results unless the query
  explicitly opts in (`search_include_low_confidence` flag in
  `anneal.toml` `[ranking]`, or `--include-low-confidence` on the
  CLI). The relation shape:

  ```
  search(query, handle, span_id, score, reason, field, low_confidence)
  ```

  Agents reading raw rows always see all hits with their
  confidence flag; agents consuming `TopK` get only high-confidence
  hits by default, eliminating the "0.62 hit looks comparable to
  0.93 hit" failure mode the live workflow simulation surfaced.

### §13 Trails [CR-D11]

**Definition CR-D11 (Trail).** A session's path through the substrate
— queries, search hits, reads, derived conclusions — captured into
`*trail` as the runtime executes. Trail capture is mandatory in
v2.0; raw expression and content capture are policy-controlled.

```
*trail{
  session_id,         // opaque; uuid unless host supplies one
  step,               // monotonic ordinal within the session
  timestamp,          // ISO datetime
  actor,              // ActorContext.actor; "anonymous-cli" by default
  corpus,             // which corpus this entry refers to
  verb,               // verb invocation name; "-e" for ad-hoc queries
  redacted_expr,      // expr with values redacted per policy
  input_hash,         // hash of full expression (deterministic provenance)
  surfaced_refs,      // list of {corpus, source, handle, span_id, score} emitted
  consumed_refs,      // subset of surfaced_refs the agent actually used
                      // in the next step (read, follow-up query, etc.)
  prelude_hash,       // hash of loaded prelude; supports reproducibility
  source_generations, // {(corpus, source): generation} snapshot at query time
  visibility,         // "public" | "team" | "private" — policy-derived
  retention,          // ISO duration; runtime garbage-collects past expiry
}
```

**Surfaced vs consumed.** `surfaced_refs` is everything the verb's
output stream contained. `consumed_refs` is the subset the agent
*acted on* — handles passed to a subsequent `read`, handles
referenced in a later query, handles selected via `run_verb`
follow-up. The runtime infers `consumed_refs` from observed
verb-to-verb dataflow within the session; explicit selection is
also possible via the `TrailSummarizer.note_consumed(handle)`
callback from a host application.

This distinction matters for trail replay (v2.1): a replay agent
re-executes consumed paths, not every surfaced candidate. The
output-explosion failure mode the live workflow simulation
surfaced — context verb surfaces 6 hits + 4 spans + 2 edges, agent
uses 1 — is resolved by recording both sets and treating consumed
as the load-bearing path.

A `TrailSummarizer` (Part VI extension seam) produces the
`redacted_expr` and may strip surfaced/consumed refs for handles
whose `visibility` is `private`. Default summarizer redacts values
inside string literals and meta-key values matching configured
patterns (`secret`, `password`, customer ids).

Trails persist to `.anneal/trails/<session-id>.jsonl` on session end.
Replay/diff workflows are forward-looking (v2.1; §47).

### §14 Provenance contract [CR-D12]

**Definition CR-D12 (Provenance).** Every output record can be
expanded via `--explain` (CLI) or `derivation: true` (MCP) into a
derivation tree:

- `search(...)` rows that brought a handle into consideration, with
  calibrated scores, optional raw scores, reasons, matched fields
- `*content` spans the engine consulted
- `*edge` rows that joined to produce each derived fact
- `*meta` and status values that participated
- rule chain (prelude, project, inline `where`) that fired
- `prelude_hash` and `source_generations` at evaluation time

Provenance is **lazy and bounded**. The IR records derivation
metadata as it computes, but the full tree is only materialized on
`--explain`. Per-record derivation is bounded to a configurable
depth (default 5 levels); deeper chains report `... + <n> more
levels (use --explain-depth)` rather than expanding.

For recursive rules, derivation is path-summarized: chains of the
same rule with bound arguments collapse to "via <rule> × N hops"
unless `--explain-depth` is explicit.

### §15 Snapshots and time travel [CR-D13]

**Definition CR-D13 (`at(<ref>)` block).** A body fragment that scopes
its sub-body to evaluate against historical corpus state.

The runtime resolves `<ref>` differently per source. Each `Source`
declares its snapshot capabilities (§5). A query that crosses
sources at time T reports **partial unsupported history**, not
silently mixes now-state and then-state:

```
warning: at("HEAD~3") evaluated against partially-supported sources:
  - markdown (anneal-md): supports_git_ref ✓ — re-extracted at HEAD~3
  - rust-code (anneal-code): supports_git_ref ✓ — re-extracted at HEAD~3
  - github-issues (anneal-issues): live_only — using current state
  - host-corpus-runtime (anneal-host): supports_time_snapshot ✓ — using nearest snapshot
```

Reference forms:

| Form | Mechanism | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `at("snapshot:last")` / `at("snapshot:<id>")` | read `.anneal/history.jsonl` | <100ms |
| `at("--7days")` / `at("2026-04-01")` | resolve to nearest snapshot | <100ms |
| `at("HEAD~3")` / `at("v0.2.1")` / `at("<sha>")` | git ref: re-run Sources with `supports_git_ref` | O(corpus) per supporting source |

### §16 `read_full` and capability gating [CR-D14]

**Definition CR-D14 (Capability gating).** Some primitives are
dangerous in unattended-agent contexts. The runtime distinguishes:

| Primitive | Default capability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `search`, `read`, `match`, `schema`, `verbs`, `describe` | Always allowed | Bounded by design |
| `read_full` | Requires `read_full` capability | Hard budget (default 8000 tokens); explicit error if larger; never exposed as a default MCP tool |
| `eval` / `-e` | Requires `eval` capability | Default-allowed for CLI; default-denied for MCP without per-tool override |
| Trail read of `private`-visibility entries | Requires `trail_private` capability | Default-denied |
| Source extraction with non-default actor | Per-`Source` policy | Adapters may scope by actor; host-embed sets this explicitly |

`ActorContext.capabilities` is set by the surface. CLI starts with
all capabilities; MCP starts with a conservative default; host-embed
sets explicitly. The `Policy` trait (§6) overrides any of the above
per project.

## Part IV: The language [CR-L]

### §17 Grammar

Modern Datalog. Named fields on stored relations, lowercase
identifiers, `:=` for "is true when," `?` for queries,
`*relation{...}` for stored data.

```

             | expr arith_op expr
function_call := ident '(' call_arg_list ')'
var         := /[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*/

agg_fn      := 'Count' | 'Sum' | 'Min' | 'Max' | 'Avg' | 'List' | 'Set'

```

Comments: `#` to end of line. Whitespace insignificant. Statements
terminated by `.`. Strings double-quoted with standard escapes.
Named predicate arguments are call-site sugar over the predicate's
declared signature. Rule heads are canonical positional definitions;
calls may use positional arguments followed by named arguments.
Named arguments are not records and do not introduce field access.

### §18 Types and operators

Dynamic, four primitive types plus one composite:

| Type | Literal |
|---|---|
| String | `"OQ-37"` |
| Number | `42`, `3.14` (unified i64/f64) |
| Bool | `true`, `false` |
| Null | `null` |
| List | `[1, 2, 3]`, `["raw", "decided"]` |

No first-class records. Records exist only as patterns inside
`*relation{...}`. Multi-column outputs from function primitives like
`search` and `read` are **relational** — pattern-match each column
into a variable:

```
? search("conformance", h, span_id, score, reason, field, low_confidence),
  low_confidence = false,
  score > 0.7,
  read(h, 4000, span_id, text, start, end, tokens).
```

This guarantees uniform handling across stored and derived
relations.

Operators:

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `=` | unification or equality (context-dependent) |
| `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | comparison; numbers, strings (lexical), dates |
| `in` | `x in [a, b, c]` or `x in *list_relation` |
| `matches` | `s matches "regex"` |
| `contains` | `s contains "substring"`; list contains element |
| `starts_with` `ends_with` | string prefix / suffix |
| `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` | arithmetic on numbers |

Built-in functions (used in expressions, not as predicates):

```
basename(path)      length(s)        lower(s)       upper(s)
max(a, b)           min(a, b)        abs(n)         days(d1, d2)
```

### §19 Stored vs derived predicates [CR-D15]

**Definition CR-D15 (Stored).** A relation prefixed `*` reads from
facts produced by Sources during ingestion or from configuration
(`*config`, `*snapshot`, `*trail`). Pattern-matching binds field
values to variables.

**Definition CR-D16 (Derived).** A relation without `*` is defined by
one or more rules. Rules may live in the prelude, in `anneal.dl`,
or inline via `where` clauses.

The `*` prefix is a visible marker: *this is real data, not
derived.*

### §20 Aggregation [CR-D17]

**Definition CR-D17 (Aggregation).** Form:
`agg_var = AggFn{ [agg_args :] contributing_var : sub_body }`.

`TopK` and `TakeUntil` take agg_args; the standard aggregators don't.

```
total_potential(area, total) :=
  total = Sum{ e : potential(h, e), area_of(h, area) }.

namespace_open_count(ns, n) :=
  n = Count{ h : *handle{id: h, namespace: ns},
                 obligation(h),
                 not discharged(h) }.

top_blockers(h, score) :=
  (h, score) = TopK{ k: 10, key: score :
    *handle{id: h, namespace: "OQ"},
    not discharged(h),
    potential(h, score)
  }.

read_until_budget(h, span_id, text, used) :=
  used = TakeUntil{ budget: 4000, sum: tokens :
    span_id : read(h, 4000, span_id, text, _, _, tokens)
  }.
```

Standard Datalog aggregation semantics: compute the set of values for
the contributing variable such that the sub-body holds, then collapse
with the aggregation function. Free variables outside the
aggregation form the grouping key. `TopK` and `TakeUntil` are
first-class — set semantics alone are insufficient for agent
retrieval workflows.

### §21 Negation, recursion, stratification [CR-D18]

**Definition CR-D18 (Stratified negation).** The runtime partitions
rules into strata such that any predicate referenced under `not` is
fully derived in an earlier stratum. Mutual recursion through
negation is rejected at load time with the cycle named.

Safety rules (enforced at load):

1. Every variable in a rule head must appear positively in the body
2. Every variable inside `not P(...)` must be bound positively
   elsewhere in the same rule
3. No mutual recursion through negation (engine names the cycle and
   all rules participating)

Load error example:

```
error: cyclic negation between 'blocked' and 'advancing'
  blocked/1 (anneal.dl:48) → not advancing(h)
  advancing/1 (anneal.dl:55) → not blocked(h)
fix: derive both from a non-mutually-negated common predicate.
```

### §22 Inline rules, includes, imports [CR-D19]

A query may declare rules visible only for that query:

```
?
  where ancient(q, d) :=
    *handle{id: q, namespace: "OQ", status: "open"},
    freshness(q, d), d > 60.
  ancient(q, d), area_of(q, "compiler").
```

External files via `include`:

```
include "checks/release.dl".
```

`include` merges rules into the global predicate space. Conflicts
form multi-clause definitions, with shadowing warnings per §27.

`import` provides namespaced loading for cases where total
shadowing is undesired:

```
import strict_checks from "checks/release.dl".

? strict_checks.broken_ref(h, why).
```

Imported names are accessed with the `module.predicate` syntax;
they do not collide with the global predicate space. `anneal.dl`
should use `import` for adapter-provided helpers and project
verb-library files; the global namespace is reserved for prelude
overrides and small project vocabularies.

### §23 Output shape [CR-D20]

**Definition CR-D20 (Output contract).**

- **stdout: pure NDJSON.** One record per match, `\n` terminated,
  streamed as derived. No verb-banner text, no "underlying query"
  print on stdout — see §25 for where the query lives.
- **stderr: human text.** Progress, warnings, parse errors with
  line/column. Never NDJSON.

Field names come from the head's variables (or for headless queries,
from the body's bindings, last-mention-wins).

Cardinality: set semantics by default (duplicates deduplicated). For
multiset, use explicit aggregation or include the full key in the
head.

Provenance: `--explain` (CLI) or `derivation: true` (MCP) adds a
`_derivation` field to each record. Without it, records are bare.

### §24 Errors

Three categories, all to stderr, all with file:line context:

**Parse errors** (load):
```
anneal.dl:42:15: expected ',' or '.', got '{'
  potential(h, energy {
                      ^
```

**Static errors** (load): safety violations, stratification cycles,
unknown predicates with did-you-mean suggestions, reserved
diagnostic IDs, adapter-qualified discovery-fact violations,
namespace import resolution failures.

**Runtime errors** (evaluation): regex compile failures, time-travel
ref not found, division by zero, capability denial.

All three exit with code 1. Stdout stays clean — no partial NDJSON
if a query failed mid-evaluation.

---

## Part V: Standard library [CR-S]

### §25 Layout

The substrate embeds the standard library at compile time. The
`prelude_hash` (a content hash of the loaded prelude files) is
recorded in every trail entry and snapshot for reproducibility.

```
anneal-core/src/prelude/
  graph.dl          # structural shapes (orphan, stub, hub)
  convergence.dl    # potential, entropy, blocked, advancing, weights
  checks.dl         # E001, E002, W001-W004, I001, S001-S005
  ranking.dl        # default Ranker calibration as Datalog rules
  views.dl          # the starter verbs as saved queries
```

`anneal source-of convergence` prints the file:lines where the
convergence vocabulary lives. `ANNEAL_PRELUDE_PATH` overrides the
embedded prelude; doing so changes the `prelude_hash` and is
recorded in trails — agents replaying a trail later see whether the
prelude differs.

### §26 Load order and shadowing [CR-D21]

**Definition CR-D21 (Load order).** Phase C of §7 loads:

1. The embedded prelude (`graph.dl`, `convergence.dl`, `checks.dl`,
   `ranking.dl`, `views.dl`)
2. `anneal.dl` rule clauses in the corpus root
3. Inline rules from `where` clauses in the current query
4. The query itself

Later layers shadow earlier layers by predicate name. **Shadowing is
total replacement.** To extend a prelude predicate rather than
replace it, provide multiple clauses for the same head in
`anneal.dl`; multi-clause definitions union as Datalog naturally
does. The runtime warns at load on stderr:

```
warning: anneal.dl:42: 'blocked/1' overrides prelude (2 clauses)
         compare: anneal source-of blocked
```

For predicates that should *never* be shadowed (engine identity
guarantees), the prelude declares `@sealed` — projects attempting to
shadow get a load error.

### §27 Convergence vocabulary [CR-D22]

**Definition CR-D22 (Convergence vocabulary).** Predicates defined in
`convergence.dl` that name the convergence-physics concepts. The
contract between the convergence frame and project predicates.

```
# convergence.dl

# Weights — projects retune in anneal.dl.
potential_weight("undischarged",     5).
potential_weight("broken_ref",       4).
potential_weight("stale_dep",        3).
potential_weight("confidence_gap",   3).
potential_weight("freshness_decay",  2).
potential_weight("missing_meta",     1).
potential_weight("orphan_label",     1).

potential(h, energy) :=
  energy = Sum{ w : entropy(h, source), potential_weight(source, w) }.

entropy(h, "undischarged") :=
  obligation(h), not discharged(h), not terminal(h).

entropy(h, "broken_ref") :=
  diagnostic("E001", _, h, _, _, _).

entropy(h, "stale_dep") :=
  *edge{from: h, to: t, kind: "depends_on"},
  active(h), terminal(t).

entropy(h, "confidence_gap") :=
  *edge{from: h, to: t, kind: "depends_on"},
  pipeline_position(h, n_h),
  pipeline_position(t, n_t),
  n_h > n_t + 1.

entropy(h, "freshness_decay") :=
  *handle{id: h, kind: "file"},
  active(h), freshness(h, days), days > 60.

entropy(h, "missing_meta") :=
  *handle{id: h, kind: "file"},
  active(h),
  not *meta{handle: h, key: "status"}.

entropy(h, "orphan_label") :=
  *handle{id: h, kind: "label"},
  cite_count(h, n: 0),
  not discharged(h).

blocked(h) :=
  active(h),
  potential(h, energy), energy >= 3,
  flux(h, days: 30, delta: 0).

advancing(h) :=
  active(h),
  recently_advanced(h).

recently_advanced(h) :=
  at("snapshot:last") { *handle{id: h, status: prior} },
  *handle{id: h, status: current},
  pipeline_position_for(prior, p_prior),
  pipeline_position_for(current, p_current),
  p_current > p_prior.
```

**The vocabulary is portable across handle graphs; the lifecycle is
not.** A code corpus where handles are functions/types doesn't have
"status: draft" frontmatter. It has coverage state, deprecation
markers, public/private visibility. Projects define their own
lifecycle by declaring `[convergence] ordering` in `anneal.toml` and
the predicates `terminal/1`, `active/1`, `pipeline_position_for/2`
in `anneal.dl` if the defaults don't fit.

Sample lifecycle profiles ship in `views.dl` for inspiration
(`profile_doc_corpus`, `profile_code_corpus`, `profile_issue_corpus`);
projects copy the one closest to their shape.

### §28 Check rules [CR-D23]

**Definition CR-D23 (Check rule).** A rule whose head is
`diagnostic(...)` deriving a fact representing a consistency
violation.

The check rules from anneal v1.x — E001 (broken refs), E002
(undischarged), W001-W004 (warnings), I001 (info), S001-S005
(suggestions) — live in `checks.dl` as Horn clauses. The substrate
has no hard-coded check logic.

```
# checks.dl excerpt

diagnostic("E001", "error", src, file, line, broken_ref(target)) :=
  *edge{from: src, to: target, kind: _, file, line},
  not *handle{id: target}.

diagnostic("W001", "warning", src, file, line,
           stale_ref(s_status, t_status)) :=
  *edge{from: src, to: target, kind: "depends_on", file, line},
  active(src), terminal(target),
  *handle{id: src, status: s_status},
  *handle{id: target, status: t_status}.
```

### §29 Diagnostic ID rules [CR-R1, CR-R2, CR-R3]

**Rule CR-R1 (Diagnostic ID literal).** Every rule whose head is
`diagnostic(...)` must have a string literal as the first argument.

**Rule CR-R2 (Unique within ruleset).** Two rules with the same
diagnostic ID literal in the same loaded ruleset error at load with
both file:line locations.

**Rule CR-R3 (Reserved prefixes).** The prefixes `E*`, `W*`, `I*`,
`S*` are prelude-owned. Projects use their own prefix
(`PROJ-001`, `RELEASE-002`).

**Projects can fully replace a built-in diagnostic** by forking the
prelude (set `ANNEAL_PRELUDE_PATH`) — the resulting `prelude_hash`
in trails reflects the divergence. Adding clauses to an existing
diagnostic ID via `anneal.dl` is rejected because diagnostic IDs
must be unique. This is intentional: a project replacing `E001`
semantics is a significant deviation and should be a deliberate
prelude fork, not a silent extension.

---

## Part VI: Project extension [CR-E]

### §30 `anneal.dl` conventions

Project predicates, verbs, and discovery facts live in `anneal.dl`
at the corpus root. Section headers organize the file:

```dl
# === discovery ===
# Consumed by Sources in Phase B of ingestion.
# Adapter-qualified: each fact names the source it targets.
md.file_extension(".md").
md.scan_root(".").
md.scan_exclude("node_modules").
md.label_pattern("OQ",    "OQ-(\d+)",    "any").
md.linear_namespace("OQ").

# === imports ===
# Use namespaced imports for adapter helpers or shared verb libraries.
import team_verbs from "verbs/team.dl".
import strict_checks from "checks/release.dl".

# === overrides ===
# Override the prelude's freshness threshold for this corpus.
entropy(h, "freshness_decay") :=
  *handle{id: h, kind: "file"},
  active(h), freshness(h, days), days > 30.

# === project predicates ===
blocking_oq(q) :=
  *handle{id: q, kind: "label", namespace: "OQ", status: "open"},
  upstream(spec, q),
  *handle{id: spec, status: "formal"}.

release_blocker(h, "broken_ref")   := diagnostic("E001", _, h, _, _, _).
release_blocker(h, "undischarged") := diagnostic("E002", _, h, _, _, _).
release_blocker(h, "blocking_oq")  :=
  blocking_oq(h),
  *meta{handle: h, key: "milestone", value: "v0.3"}.

# === verbs ===
@verb(
  name: "release-blockers",
  query: "? release_blocker(h, why).",
  doc: "Open OQs and broken references gating the next release.",
  output_schema: { h: HandleId, why: String },
  default_args: {},
  capabilities: ["read"]
)
```

**Discovery facts are adapter-qualified** (`md.file_extension`,
`code.module_pattern`, etc.) so two adapters can't silently fight
over the same key. The runtime errors at load if a discovery fact
prefix names an adapter that isn't linked, unless the prefix is
declared optional:

```
md.file_extension(".md").                 # error if anneal-md not linked
optional code.module_pattern("**/*.rs").  # silently skipped if anneal-code absent
```

### §31 Steele's criterion for verbs [CR-R4]

**Rule CR-R4 (Verb extensibility).** A verb declared in `anneal.dl`
via `@verb(...)` is syntactically indistinguishable from a verb
shipped in the prelude. Identical:

- Discovery: `anneal verbs` lists both
- Help: `anneal describe <verb>` works for both
- Output envelope: same NDJSON shape, same `--explain` support, same
  declared `output_schema`
- Callable shape: a rule body references the verb's *underlying
  predicate* (verbs are predicates with a query body and declared
  output schema; not opaque saved strings)
- Documentation surface: `examples` work for both
- Capabilities: both honor the declared `capabilities` list

`@verb` is structured: `name` (snake-or-hyphen-case), `query`
(string, parsed at load to AST), `doc` (string), `output_schema`
(field name → type), `default_args` (argument bindings), and
`capabilities` (list of required ActorContext capabilities). The
runtime validates `query` against `output_schema` at load.

### §32 Discovery fact contract

Adapters declare their consumed discovery facts in `SourceInfo.config_keys`:

```rust
SourceInfo {
    name: "markdown",
    config_keys: vec![
        ConfigKey::required("md.file_extension"),
        ConfigKey::required("md.scan_root"),
        ConfigKey::optional("md.scan_exclude"),
        ConfigKey::optional("md.label_pattern"),
        ConfigKey::optional("md.linear_namespace"),
        ConfigKey::optional("md.version_pattern"),
    ],
    ...
}
```

The runtime errors at load if a corpus's `anneal.dl` declares a
required discovery fact whose prefix is recognized by no linked
adapter. The user fixes by linking the adapter, qualifying the fact
for a linked adapter, or marking the fact `optional`.

**Single-adapter sugar.** When exactly one adapter is linked, the
runtime auto-qualifies unqualified discovery facts to that adapter:

```dl
# In a markdown-only project, this is allowed:
file_extension(".md").              # auto-qualified to md.file_extension
label_pattern("OQ", "OQ-(\d+)", "any").

# In a multi-adapter project, the same line errors at load:
error: anneal.dl:4: ambiguous discovery fact 'file_extension'
       multiple linked adapters declare config keys with this name:
         - md.file_extension (anneal-md)
         - mdx.file_extension (anneal-mdx)
       resolve by qualifying explicitly (md.file_extension or mdx.file_extension)
```

This removes the ergonomic tax on single-adapter corpora (the
common case) while keeping the disambiguation guarantee on
multi-adapter corpora. The user discovers which mode applies via
`anneal sources` — listing one adapter means unqualified facts
work; listing more requires qualification.

---

## Part VII: Surfaces [CR-Su]

### §33 The starter verbs

The prelude's `views.dl` ships these as saved verb declarations.
Projects override or extend any.

| Verb | Question | Underlying query (sketch) |
|---|---|---|
| `anneal` | where am I | composed of summary, work, advancing, blocked |
| `anneal H` | what is this handle | `*handle{id: H, ...}` + immediate edges |
| `anneal find TEXT` | identity-search by id substring | `*handle{id, ...}, id contains "TEXT"` |
| `anneal search TEXT` | content match by query | `search("TEXT", h, span_id, score, reason, field, low_confidence)` |
| `anneal context GOAL` | composition for cold-agent localization | see §33.1 |
| `anneal read H` | give me H's content, bounded | `read(H, budget, span_id, text, start, end, tokens)` |
| `anneal work` | where should I work | `(h, e) = TopK{k: 25, key: e : potential(h, e), entropy(h, src)}` |
| `anneal blocked H` | what's blocking H | `entropy("H", source), entropy_detail(...)` |
| `anneal trend` | corpus over time | `at(--at) { ... }` vs `at("now") { ... }` |
| `anneal broken` | are there errors | `diagnostic(_, "error", ...)` |

Plus self-description verbs from §11: `schema`, `predicates`, `verbs`,
`describe`, `source-of`, `examples`, `sources`.

Plus meta forms:

| Form | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `anneal -e '<q>'` | custom query; `-e -` reads from stdin |
| `anneal init` | scaffold a corpus with starter `anneal.toml` + `anneal.dl` |
| `anneal --prelude-path` | print the embedded-prelude inspection path |
| `anneal --inspect S` | parse-test a string against handle conventions |

### §33.1 The `context` verb [CR-D30]

**Definition CR-D30 (Context verb).** The `context` verb is the
load-bearing primitive for cold-agent localization. It composes
`search`, `read`, and `neighborhood` into a single budgeted call
that returns enough to make progress without a second tool call.

```
anneal context GOAL [--budget=N] [--neighborhood-depth=D] [--hits=K]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--budget=N` | `4000` tokens | total token budget across hits + spans + neighborhood |
| `--neighborhood-depth=D` | `1` | edges to traverse outward from the top hit |
| `--hits=K` | `3` | candidates to return (after `TopK` filtering) |

Underlying composition contract (from `views.dl`):

```dl
@verb(
  name: "context",
  query: "
    ? (h, span_id, score, reason, field) = TopK{ k: hits, key: score :
        search(goal, h, span_id, score, reason, field, low_confidence),
        low_confidence = false
      },
      per_hit_budget = budget * 0.6 / hits,
      (span_id, text, start_line, end_line, tokens) = TakeUntil{
        budget: per_hit_budget, sum: tokens :
        (span_id, text, start_line, end_line, tokens) :
          read(h, per_hit_budget, span_id, text, start_line, end_line, tokens)
      },
      neighborhood_or_self(h, neighborhood_depth, neighbor).
  ",
  output_schema: {
    goal: String,
    hits: List<{h, span_id, score, reason, field}>,
    spans: List<{h, span_id, start_line, end_line, tokens, text}>,
    neighborhood: List<{h, neighbor}>
  },
  capabilities: ["read"]
)
```

The `context` output is grouped by the verb surface from relational
rows into `hits`, `spans`, and `neighborhood`; grouping is an
`output_schema` concern, not record-style field access in the query
language. `views.dl` defines `neighborhood_or_self/3` so an otherwise
isolated top hit still returns its read span. Phase 1 must pin this
as an executable `views.dl` fixture before `context` is treated as a
shipped verb.

Budget allocation: 60% to span reads on top hits, 20% to
neighborhood expansion, 20% reserved for `--explain` if requested.
The runtime adjusts allocations downward when the requested K hits
or D-depth neighborhood don't exist; it never overruns.

Cold-agent test (§49 large-corpus fixture) targets a single `context`
call after an optional `anneal` dashboard — total tool calls ≤2,
counted including any required follow-ups.

### §34 Query echo behavior [CR-D24]

**Definition CR-D24 (Query echo).** When a verb runs, the runtime
prints the underlying query above the result *on stderr*, not on
stdout. Stdout stays pure NDJSON. Optionally `--meta` adds a single
NDJSON envelope record on stdout containing the underlying query
and runtime info:

```
$ anneal blocked OQ-37 --meta
{"_meta": {"verb": "blocked", "query": "? entropy(\"OQ-37\", src), …", "prelude_hash": "…", …}}
{"src": "undischarged", "detail": "namespace OQ open 82 days"}
{"src": "stale_dep", "detail": "depends_on .design/synth/discharge.md (superseded)"}
```

Without `--meta`, stdout is bare rows; the query is echoed only on
stderr. Agents consuming stdout via pipe (`jq`, `xargs`) never see
the echo.

### §35 CLI flags

Most flags are operational. Any flag that changes result policy is
called out explicitly and mirrored by config or query predicates;
filters still belong in queries.

| Flag | Effect | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `--root=PATH` | operate on a different corpus | global |
| `--at=<ref>` | evaluate at a historical reference | global |
| `--limit=N` | cap output records | global |
| `--explain` | include `_derivation` per record | global |
| `--explain-depth=N` | derivation expansion depth (default 5) | global |
| `--meta` | emit `_meta` envelope record on stdout | global |
| `--no-snapshot` | don't append history on this run | global |
| `--quiet` | suppress stderr chatter | global |
| `--budget=N` | token budget for `work` / `read` / `context` | verb-specific |
| `--gate` | exit 1 if any results | `broken` |
| `--source=NAME` | restrict ingestion to one Source | global |
| `--mcp` | start as MCP server on stdin/stdout | global |
| `--color=auto` | TTY detect; pipes get plain text | global |
| `--pretty` | human-readable formatted JSON (breaks NDJSON contract) | global |
| `--include-low-confidence` | include hits with `low_confidence: true` in `TopK` | global, search-relevant |

### §36 I/O contract [CR-D25]

**Definition CR-D25 (I/O contract).**

- **stdout: pure NDJSON.** Bare record stream; `--meta` adds one
  envelope record at the top. Pipe to `jq` for human-readable
  formatting: `anneal | jq` is the canonical pretty-print path. The
  `--pretty` flag is also available for in-process formatting; it
  emits multi-line JSON and breaks the NDJSON contract, so it is
  human-only and never used in agent pipelines or `--mcp` mode.
- **stderr: human text.** Verb-banner echo, progress, warnings,
  parse errors. Never NDJSON.
- **stdin: `-` means stdin.** `anneal blocked -` reads handles, one
  per line. `anneal -e -` reads a query (heredoc-friendly).
- **Exit codes:** 0 success (including empty results), 1 query
  error, 2 invocation error, 3 gate failure.

### §37 MCP surface [CR-D26]

**Definition CR-D26 (MCP transport).** `anneal --mcp` (or the
`anneal-mcp` binary) starts a stdio MCP server. The tool surface is
**not 1:1 with verbs.** Tool inflation is a real failure mode; v2.0
ships a small stable surface that scales by introspection, not by
verb count.

Default MCP tool surface:

| Tool | Wraps | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `eval` | `-e '<query>'` | gated by `eval` capability; default-denied for MCP unless `[mcp] allow_eval = true` or host policy grants it |
| `search` | `search` primitive | always allowed |
| `read` | `read` primitive (budgeted) | always allowed |
| `verbs` | `verbs` primitive | always allowed; agents see all available verbs |
| `describe` | `describe` primitive | always allowed |
| `schema` | `schema` primitive | always allowed |
| `source_of` | `source_of` primitive | always allowed |
| `dashboard` | the `anneal` verb | always allowed |
| `run_verb` | invoke any verb by name | gated by per-verb declared capabilities |

`read_full` is **not** a default MCP tool. Projects may expose it
via explicit configuration in `anneal.toml` `[mcp]` if they accept
the data-exfiltration risk.

`run_verb` is the agent's entry to project-defined verbs without
flooding the top-level tool list. `tools/list` returns the ~10 tools
above; the agent discovers project verbs via `verbs` then calls them
via `run_verb`.

Server instructions include the standard-library prelude content
under a *trusted prelude* heading, separated from any *untrusted
corpus content* an agent might subsequently see via `search` or
`read`. Project `@verb` docs are quoted as data, not promoted into
instruction frames.

### §38 Plugin surfaces [CR-D27]

**Definition CR-D27 (Pluggable extension seams).** Beyond `Source`,
the runtime exposes three extension surfaces:

```rust
pub trait Ranker {
    fn calibrate(&self, hit: &SearchHit, ctx: &RankingContext) -> f32;
    fn tie_break(&self, a: &SearchHit, b: &SearchHit) -> Ordering;
}

pub trait Policy {
    fn check(&self, actor: &ActorContext, action: &Action) -> PolicyDecision;
}

pub trait TrailSummarizer {
    fn summarize(&self, entry: &TrailEntryInProgress, ctx: &TrailContext) -> TrailSummary;
    fn redact(&self, expr: &str, ctx: &TrailContext) -> String;
}
```

Default impls ship in `anneal-core`. Adapters override `Ranker` for
their hit shapes; hosts override `Policy` for actor-based
authorization; projects override `TrailSummarizer` to control what
gets recorded.

---

## Part VIII: Onboarding [CR-O]

### §39 Lattice-on default [CR-D28]

**Definition CR-D28 (Init defaults).** `anneal init` always scaffolds
a minimal lattice and a starter `anneal.dl` referencing the
prelude's convergence vocabulary:

```
$ anneal init

scanning corpus...
  found 47 markdown files
  inferred Source: anneal-md (linked)
  status frontmatter: present in 41/47 (87%)
  inferred lattice: raw → draft → current → stable

wrote anneal.toml
  [convergence]
  ordering = ["raw", "draft", "current", "stable"]
  active = ["draft", "current", "stable"]
  terminal = ["superseded", "archived"]

wrote anneal.dl (16 lines)
  # === discovery ===
  md.file_extension(".md").
  …

next steps:
  anneal                       see the landscape
  anneal source-of convergence read what convergence means here
  anneal work                  pick where to work
```

The agent's first session lands in convergence mode, not graph mode.
Graph mode (lattice-off) requires `[convergence] disabled = true`
in `anneal.toml`.

### §40 The agent loop [CR-D29]

**Definition CR-D29 (Agent loop).**

```
1. anneal                  see the landscape
2. anneal work             pick where to work
3. anneal blocked H        understand why H isn't moving
4. (do the work)
5. anneal trend            confirm potential dissipated
```

For arrival on an unfamiliar corpus, prepend:

```
0a. anneal sources         what adapters are loaded
0b. anneal source-of convergence  what convergence means here
```

For multi-session handoff, prepend:

```
0c. anneal -e '? *trail{session_id: last, step, redacted_expr, consumed_refs}.'
```

---

## Part IX: Handle model [CR-H]

### §41 Kinds

Five handle kinds are substrate-shaped:

| Kind | Examples by Source |
|---|---|
| `file` | markdown file (anneal-md), MDX file (anneal-mdx), Rust module (anneal-code), Ash resource (anneal-host) |
| `section` | markdown heading (anneal-md), Rust impl block, Phoenix scope |
| `label` | OQ-22 (anneal-md frontmatter), RFC-101 (anneal-code attribute), GitHub issue #42 (anneal-issues) |
| `version` | versioned spec (`formal-model-v17.md`), semver-tagged release |
| `external` | URL, external API reference, dependency |

The Source decides the mapping. Display id is locally unique within
`(corpus, source)`; internal identity is
`(corpus, source, kind, native_id)`.

### §42 Discovery configuration

Adapter-qualified discovery facts per §32. The markdown adapter's
shape:

```
md.file_extension(".md").
md.scan_root(".").
md.scan_exclude("node_modules").
md.label_pattern("OQ",    "OQ-(\d+)",    "any").
md.label_pattern("KB-D",  "KB-D(\d+)",   ".design/**").
md.linear_namespace("OQ").
md.version_pattern("formal-model", "formal-model-v(\d+)\.md").
md.section_min_depth(1).
md.section_max_depth(3).
```

Other adapters declare their own (`code.module_pattern`,
`issues.repo`, etc.). The runtime errors if a required fact's prefix
isn't recognized by a linked Source; `optional` facts are skipped
when the adapter is absent.

### §43 Introspection

```
# 1. Counts by kind
anneal -e '? c = Count{ h : *handle{id: h, kind: k} }, k.'

# 2. Label namespaces and counts
anneal -e '? c = Count{ h : *handle{id: h, kind: "label", namespace: ns} }, ns.'

# 3. The corpus's discovery conventions (adapter-qualified)
anneal -e '? md.label_pattern(ns, regex, scope).'

# 4. Inspect a specific string
anneal --inspect "OQ-99"

# 5. Read directly
cat anneal.dl
anneal describe handles
```

---

## Part X: Files and layout [CR-FL]

### §44 Project files

```
<corpus>/
  anneal.toml           # engine config: lattice, [convergence], [ranking], [mcp], [policy]
  anneal.dl             # discovery facts + project predicates + verbs + overrides
  .anneal/
    history.jsonl       # snapshot append log
    trails/             # session paths
      <session-id>.jsonl
    generations/        # generation tracking for retraction
      <source>.json     # current generation per source
```

### §45 Substrate files (embedded)

```
anneal-core/src/prelude/
  graph.dl
  convergence.dl
  checks.dl
  ranking.dl
  views.dl
```

Compile-time embedded; `ANNEAL_PRELUDE_PATH` overrides (and changes
the recorded `prelude_hash`).

---

## Part XI: Migration from v1.x [CR-M]

### §46 Command mapping

Every v1.x command is reachable in v2.0:

| v1.x | v2.0 |
|---|---|
| `anneal status` | `anneal` |
| `anneal get H` | `anneal H` |
| `anneal find TEXT` | `anneal find TEXT` (identity search; unchanged) |
| (new) | `anneal search TEXT` (content retrieval) |
| (new) | `anneal context GOAL` (search + read in one verb) |
| `anneal check` | `anneal broken` or `anneal -e '? diagnostic(c, s, ...).'` |
| `anneal check --errors-only` | `anneal broken --gate` |
| `anneal map --around=H` | `anneal -e '? neighborhood("H", 2, x).'` |
| `anneal impact H` | `anneal -e '? impact("H", x, depth).'` |
| `anneal obligations` | `anneal -e '? obligation(h), disposition(h).'` |
| `anneal diff` | `anneal trend` |
| `anneal areas` | `anneal -e '? area_health(area, grade, ...).'` |
| `anneal orient` | `anneal work` |
| `anneal garden` | `anneal -e '? maintenance_task(t, category, blast).'` |
| `anneal init` | `anneal init` (now lattice-on by default) |
| `anneal prime` | `anneal describe runtime` |

### §47 Migration path

1. **`anneal-core`.** Datalog runtime, primitives, IR, embedded
   prelude.
2. **`anneal-md`.** Refactor v1.x parse pipeline behind `Source`.
3. **`anneal-cli` + `anneal-mcp`.** Surfaces over the shared core.
4. **Dual ship.** v1.x and v2.0 binaries in parallel for one minor
   release; v1.x prints deprecation warnings.
5. **Documentation.** SKILL.md, README.md rewritten.

### §48 What stays unchanged

Core model from `anneal-spec.md` Parts I-III: handle definition,
graph construction, convergence lattice, local check semantics,
linearity, impact analysis, convergence tracking, design
principles, theoretical lineage.

---

## Part XII: Acceptance [CR-Acc]

### §49 Workflow-completion gates [CR-R5]

**Rule CR-R5 (Workflow gates).** v2.0 ships when these pinned
cold-agent fixtures pass:

**Fixture: large-corpus/v17-conformance-audit**

- *Corpus*: `/path/to/large-corpus/.design/` at git ref `v17-audit-fixture`
  (frozen for reproducibility)
- *Goal*: "Find the most urgent thing blocking v17 conformance and
  read enough context to make progress."
- *Pass criteria*:
  - Top-3 `search` result for query `"v17 conformance audit"` includes
    `reviews/2026-04-28-formal-model-v17-conformance-audit.md` with
    `score > 0.7` and `reason` in
    `{"title-match", "frontmatter-key-match"}`
  - Following `read` on that handle returns the file's `## Method`
    or `## Summary` section in first span
  - `--explain` shows the rank derivation citing both score and
    field
- *Tool-call target*: 2 calls (search + read) with `MRR ≥ 0.5`
  across cold-agent runs
- *Context target*: `anneal context "v17 conformance audit"` after
  an optional `anneal` dashboard returns the same audit handle and
  a useful first span in ≤2 total calls

**Fixture: anneal/release-blocker**

- *Corpus*: `/path/to/anneal/.design/` at the v2.0-release-fixture tag
- *Goal*: "What's blocking the v2.0 release?"
- *Pass criteria*: `anneal -e '? release_blocker(h, why).'` returns
  at least one row whose `why` is grounded in a derived diagnostic
  visible via `--explain`

**Fixture: host-corpus-host/runtime-snapshot** (v2.1+ when
`anneal-host` lands; v2.0 declares the fixture shape only)

- *Corpus*: a host-corpus instance with `anneal-host` adapter linked
- *Goal*: "Which Ash actions have no test coverage in `accounts`?"
- *Pass criteria*: same workflow gates apply

Additional workflow targets:

| Workflow | Target |
|---|---|
| "What's the corpus state?" | 1 call (`anneal`) |
| "Where is X?" | 2 calls (`search` + `read`) |
| "What does X depend on?" | 2 calls (`anneal H` or `-e upstream`) |
| "What changed in 7 days?" | 1 call (`anneal trend --at=--7days`) |
| "Why is this fact here?" | 1 call (`--explain`) |
| "Extend the vocabulary" | Write 5 lines in `anneal.dl`; verb available next invocation |
| "Recover what a prior agent did" | 1 call (`anneal -e '? *trail{...}.'`) |

### §50 Substrate validation

MVS-1..9 from the engine-spike protocol validate the substrate's
ability to execute the rule layer. Workflow gates above validate the
product. Both must hold.

### §51 Performance gates

Per SP-R1 of `2026-05-07-engine-spike-and-parity-protocol.md`:

| Sub-criterion | Target |
|---|---|
| Cold full evaluation on large-corpus | <2s |
| Warm full evaluation | <200ms |
| Snapshot `at()` | <500ms |
| Git-ref `at()` | <5× snapshot cost |
| Resident memory | <200MB |
| Dependency unsafe | audited, contained, or `unsafe_code = deny` |

---

## Part XIII: Forward-looking [CR-Fw]

### §52 Trail-driven workflows (v2.1)

v2.0 captures trails (§13). v2.1 adds:

- `anneal trail replay <session-id>` — re-runs the path against the
  current corpus state, surfacing what's changed
- `anneal trail diff <a> <b>` — compares two sessions
- `anneal trail summarize <session-id>` — markdown digest for
  inclusion in commit messages or PRs

### §53 Multi-corpus federation (v2.2)

UI for queries across corpora. The *schema* is in v2.0 (every fact
has `corpus`, `source`, `origin_uri`); the *surface* is v2.2.

```
anneal --root .design --root /path/to/host-corpus/.design --root /path/to/large-corpus/.design \
       -e '? *handle{id: h, corpus: c}, c != "self".'
```

### §54 Adapters beyond markdown (v2.1+)

- **anneal-mdx**: MDX with JSX-island parsing
- **anneal-code**: Rust/Elixir/TS source — handles as functions/types
- **anneal-issues**: GitHub/Linear — issues as handles
- **anneal-host**: library API for embedding (host-corpus)

### §55 Host Corpus embedding (v2.1+)

Concrete use case for `anneal-host`: host-corpus embeds `anneal-core` as
a Rust dep alongside its Elixir runtime. Host Corpus-side adapter exposes
Ash resources, Phoenix routes, Oban jobs, decision-log entries, and
customer-state transitions as handles. The same agent skill that
runs in large-corpus's `.design/` runs inside host-corpus.

---

## Part XIV: Open questions [CR-OQ]

### §56 take_until aggregation behavior

§20 declares `TakeUntil` but its exact semantics on non-numeric
contributing variables and on tied threshold-crossings need pinning
during Phase 1.

### §57 Cross-adapter score calibration in the default `Ranker`

§12 defines per-adapter score range, reason vocabulary, and
confidence threshold. The default `Ranker`'s calibration formula
across adapters is a Phase 1 design question. Probably:
linear-rescale by adapter quartiles + bonus for matched fields
named in the user query + low-confidence filter applied last.

### §58 Default trail summarizer redaction patterns

§13 says default summarizer redacts values in string literals and
meta-key values matching configured patterns. The default pattern
set (`secret`, `password`, etc.) needs review; probably project-
overridable via `[trail]` in `anneal.toml`.

### §59 Distinguishing consumed-by-read from consumed-by-display

§13 distinguishes `surfaced_refs` from `consumed_refs`. The runtime
infers `consumed_refs` from observed verb-to-verb dataflow. Two
edge cases: an agent that reads then never uses the content (the
read is consumption-of-attention but not consumption-of-output);
an agent that bulk-surfaces and silently drops most. Default heuristic
TBD: lean toward `consumed = handles that appeared in a subsequent
verb's input within the same session`.

### §60 MCP run_verb routing

§37's `run_verb` dispatches by verb name. Naming collisions across
shadowed verbs (prelude vs project) need a documented resolution:
project verbs win over prelude verbs (per CR-R4), but MCP must
expose only the resolved name, not both.

### §61 Performance ceiling

For corpora with hundreds of thousands of handles and rich rule
sets, evaluation time grows. The substrate is designed for
hundreds-of-thousands; tens-of-millions probably needs indexed
evaluation. Out of scope for v2.0.

### §62 Context verb executable contract

§33.1 defines the `context` verb as a grouped, budgeted composition
over `search`, `read`, and `neighborhood_or_self`. Phase 1 must pin
the exact executable `views.dl` form and the row-to-group
`output_schema` behavior in tests before `context` becomes a shipped
verb. This is a contract question, not a UX polish item, because the
cold-agent gate depends on it.
